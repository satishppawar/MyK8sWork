# Running K3s with Docker Runtime

- K3s by default comes with containerd runtime, to use docker as container runtime for K3s then use be
low docker argument with K3s command

```
$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --docker

```

```
$ k3s --version
k3s version v1.18.2+k3s1 (698e444a)
```

```
$ sudo k3s kubectl get nodes
NAME     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
raspi2   Ready    master   35h   v1.18.2+k3s1
```


```
$ sudo k3s kubectl get componentstatus
NAME                 STATUS    MESSAGE   ERROR
scheduler            Healthy   ok

```
$ sudo kubectl get nodes
NAME     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION

```

If you run kubectl get pods --all-namespaces, you will see some extra pods for Traefik. Traefik is a reverse proxy and load balancer that we can use to direct traffic into our cluster from a single entry point. Kubernetes allows for this but doesn't provide such a service directly. Having Traefik installed by default is a nice touch by Rancher Labs. This makes a default k3s install fully complete and immediately usable!

We're going to explore using Traefik through Kubernetes ingress rules and deploy all kinds of goodies to our cluster in future articles. Stay tuned!
