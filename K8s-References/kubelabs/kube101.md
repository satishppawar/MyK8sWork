Click on Add Instances to setup first k8s node cluster

## Cloning the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/collabnix/kubelabs
```

## Bootstrapping the First Node Cluster

```
sh bootstrap.sh
```

# What does this script do?

The first line `kubeadm init` initializes a Kubernetes control-plane node and execute the below phases:

```
The “init” command executes the following phases:

preflight                    Run pre-flight checks
kubelet-start                Write kubelet settings and (re)start the kubelet

```

## Adding New K8s Cluster Node

Click on `Add Instances` to setup first k8s node cluster

Wait for 1 minute time till it gets completed.

Copy the command starting with ```kubeadm join ....```. We will need it to be run on the worker node.


## Setting up Worker Node

Click on `Add New Instance` and paste the last `kubeadm` command on this fresh new worker node.

```
[node2 ~]$ kubeadm join --token 4f924f.14eb7618a20d2ece 192.168.0.8:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash  sha256:a5c25aa4573e06a0c11b11df23c8f85c95bae36cbb07d5e7879d9341a3ec67b3```
```

You will see the below output:

```

```

# Verifying Kubernetes Cluster

Run the below command on master node

```
[node1 ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME      STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
node1     Ready     master    15m       v1.10.2
node2     Ready     <none>    1m        v1.10.2
[node1 ~]$
```

## Adding Worker Nodes

```
[node1 ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME      STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
node1     Ready     master    58m       v1.10.2
node2     Ready     <none>    57m       v1.10.2
node3     Ready     <none>    57m       v1.10.2
node4     Ready     <none>    57m       v1.10.2
node5     Ready     <none>    54s       v1.10.2
```

```
[node1 istio]$ kubectl get po
No resources found.
```

```
[node1 ]$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   1h
[node1 $
```

### Show the capacity of all our nodes as a stream of JSON objects

```
kubectl get nodes -o json |
      jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .status.capacity"
 ```

## Accessing namespaces

By default, `kubectl` uses the default namespace. We can switch to a different namespace with the `-n` option

### List the pods in the kube-system namespace:

```
kubectl -n kube-system get pods
```

```
[node1 kubelabs]$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

## What are all these pods?


- **etcd** is our etcd server
- **kube-apiserver** is the API server
- **kube-controller-manager** and **kube-scheduler** are other master components
- **kube-dns** is an additional component (not mandatory but super useful, so it’s there)
- **kube-proxy** is the (per-node) component managing port mappings and such
- **weave** is the (per-node) component managing the network overlay 

The `READY` column indicates the number of containers in each pod.
Pods with a name ending with `-node1` are the master components (they have been specifically “pinned” to the master node).
